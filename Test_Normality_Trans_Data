# "The Tukey ladder of powers (sometimes called the Bulging Rule) is a way to change the shape of a skewed distribution so that it becomes normal or nearly-normal. 
# It can also help to reduce error variability (heteroscedasticity). 
# Tukey (1977) created a table of powers (numbers to which data can be raised)."
