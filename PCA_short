# By default, the prcomp function centers the variables to have mean zero. 
# By using the option scale = TRUE, we scale the variables to have standard deviation one. 
# The output from prcomp contains a number of useful quantities.

#
# The "center" and "scale" components correspond to the means and SD of the variables
# that were used for scaling prior to implementing PCA
#
# means
pca$center
#
# SD
pca$scale
#
#
# The "rotation" matrix provides the PC loadings;
# each column of pca1$rotation contains the corresponding PC loading vector
#
pca$rotation
#
#
# Obtain the PC scores from the results
# If we project the n data points x1,...,xn onto the first eigenvector,
# the projected values are called the principal component scores for each observation.
#
pca$x

#
# Variance Explained by each PC 
#
pca$sdev
#
(VE <- pca$sdev^2)
#
# The Proportion of Variance explained by each PC
#
PVE <- VE / sum(VE)
round(PVE, 2)
