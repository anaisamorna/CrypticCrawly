# The random effects part is here:
# Random effects:
#   Groups   Name        Variance Std.Dev.
# block    (Intercept) 0.000    0.000   
# Residual             2.883    1.698   
# Number of obs: 287, groups:  block, 4
# The part of interest is the VARIANCE term of the BLOCK INTERCEPT
# This represents the variance in model estimate BETWEEN blocks
# Here it is ZERO - the random effect adds nothing
